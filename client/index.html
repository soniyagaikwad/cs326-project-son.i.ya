        <h3 id="description">Have you ever felt like you're listening to the same songs over and over again? And, you
            want to branch out
            but
            still match the vibe you're looking for? MUSES will give a song list recommendation to consider adding to
            your
            playlist!</h3>
        <h4 id="instruction">Instructions: Below, you will see a few questions asking what genre, song vibe, and decade
            you would like
            your
            recommended song list to include. For these questions, click on the box that matches your interests. After
            you
            answer all the questions, you will see a list of the top 5 songs recommended just for you! After getting
            this
            list, you will see a thumbs up and thumbs down button. If you like the recommended song list, click the
            thumbs
            up, but if you don't, click on the thumbs down, and MUSES will curate a new list of songs until you find a
            list
            that matches you most!</h4>
