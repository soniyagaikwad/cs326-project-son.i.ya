## Instructions
You will see a few questions asking what genre, song vibe, and decade you would like your recommended song list to include. For these questions, click on the box that matches your interests. After you answer all the questions, you will see a list of the top songs recommended just for you! After getting this list, you will see a thumbs up and thumbs down button. If you like the recommended song list, click the thumbs up, but if you don't, click on the thumbs down, and MUSES will curate a new list of songs until you find a list that matches you most!
