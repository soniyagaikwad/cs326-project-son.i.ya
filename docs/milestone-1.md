## Application Idea
Have you ever felt like you're listening to the same songs over and over again? And, you want to branch out but still match the vibe you're looking for? MUSES will give a song list recommendation to consider adding to your playlist! 

This application will have a backend song database labeled with different properties that my artificially intelligent song list recommender will use.

## Functionality
As mentioned earlier in the application idea, MUSES will provide a song list recommendation based on user input. Before giving a recommendation, the user will be asked a few questions, such as the genre, song vibe, and decade. With this information, MUSES will present the top 5 songs that meet the user's criteria. After the recommendation is given, the user will be asked if they like or dislike the list. If they dislike the list, a new list would be created with five new songs until they like the recommendation list.

## Wishlist
- Ability to download the top 5 recommended list
- Use Bootstrap to beautify the application
- Ability to review application or give feedback
