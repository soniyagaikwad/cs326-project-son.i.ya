# Data Interactions
- MUSES will provide a song list recommendation based on user input. 
- Before giving a recommendation, the user will be asked a few questions, such as the genre, song vibe, and decade. 
- With this information, MUSES will present the top 5 songs that meet the user's criteria. 
- After the recommendation is given, the user will be asked if they like or dislike the list. 
- If they dislike the list, a new list would be created with five new songs until they like the recommendation list.
